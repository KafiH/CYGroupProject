# KESHB Schools
**Welcome to KESHB Schools!**
* Code Youth's: Intake-8 has designed a gamified curriculum application that puts its players progress first.
* We encourage our player's progression by celebrating each learning milestone through an incremental reward system: merit points, badges, and certifications.

**Merit points:**
* Accumulated through player interaction (signing up, linking social accounts, connecting with other players, completing modules, passing quizzes, etc.)
* They are redeemable in the shop where players can support one another by purchasing profile pictures designed by developers and other players.

**Badges:**
* Awarded on completion of each quiz (bronze for 70%+, silver for 80%+, and gold for 90%+)
* Displayed on pages such as Chapter Summary, Profile, Shop, and Leader Board.
**Certifications:**
* Awarded on completion at the end of each course 
* An icon will be displayed on the player's profile which will hold a downloadable certificate to be shared on social media / linked to a resume.



## Steakholders

### Players:
* Whether they are looking to improve their skills, searching for a career path, or just having fun!
* This application provides them with a trackable public learning experience to present to Hiring Managers.
* Our tracking system provides Players with the analytics to show them where they excel and what needs improvement. Their profiles can be linked to their resume to show proof of education.
* From the players’ profile, potential clients and recruiters can follow a link to their GitHub as well as view a sample of their most recent work on an embedded codepen

### Recruiters:
**Schools:**
* Can integrate this into their curriculum to track their student's progress. Through the points, badge, and certification system teachers are able to see where students are spending their time and where they may need help.
**Hiring Managers:**
* Can use this as a reference point for new applicants, as proof of education.
By getting a deeper understanding of the player's specialties and interests, hiring managers can better place applicants.

## Pages

### Curriculum:
* In this version, our curriculum follows a Roadmap to Web Design. Apart from the coding languages, we will have segments for ‘how to learn’ code,  what to expect as a beginner, setting up editors, connecting to GitHub, and working in a team (SCRUM).

### Quiz:
* A quiz will appear at the end of each module to help our users visualize their progress. The badges represent their understanding of what they have retained. 
* It is important to note that players will be able to progress through the modules regardless of receiving a passing grade.

### Profile:
Each profile will reflect user progress, as well as their growing specializations as they progress through the curriculum.
**Profile Card:**
* Profile photo (designed in-app)
* identification
* Social links
* Merit points
* Streaks to keep users coming back every day
* Badges
**Certifications Container:**
* Completed courses
**Progress Container:**
* Reflects user progression through each course

### Achievements:
#### Redeem:
Users can come here to view their achievements and redeem merit points
#### Shop:
**The profile Photos:**
* Profile photos are unique designs purchasable with redemption points.
* Users can submit their own designs (to be reviewed by the admin)
* Users can set their prices and sell them in the shop for more merit points
* By purchasing other users' designs we encourage them to support each other by displaying them on their profile
**Themes:**
* Developers will create additional themes for user profiles to reflect the user's personality. Users will also be able to submit their themes on review of the shop.


### Leader Board:
* To cultivate a space of healthy competition we added a leaderboard for users to get the top space. At the end of each streak, the top three users will receive a prize of a profile picture to display on their profile. To encourage other users to compete any user to make it onto the leader board will receive a badge.

## Future Features
**Group Projects**
* Applying the SCRUM theory learned in the curriculum users will be encouraged to complete “group projects”. 
* Using the prompts provided by the curriculum, users will be encouraged to connect through discord to collaborate.
