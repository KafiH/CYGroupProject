#KESHB Schools
    Welcome to KESHB Schools!
    Intake-8 from Code Youth has designed a gamified curriculum application that puts its users progress first.

    We encourage our user's progression by celebrating each learning milestone through an incremental reward system: merit points, badges, and certifications.

- Merit points:
    Accumulated through user interaction (signing up, linking social accounts, connecting with other users, completing modules, passing quizzes, etc.)
    They are redeemable in the shop where users can purchase profile pictures designed by developers and other users.

Badges:
    Awarded on completion of each quiz (bronze for 70%+, silver for 80%+, and gold for 90%+)
    Displayed on pages such as Chapter Summary, Profile, Shop, and Leader Board.

Certifications:
    Awarded on completion at the end of each course 
    An icon will be displayed on the user's profile which will hold a downloadable certificate to be shared on social media / linked to a resume.

The Users:
    New Developers. Whether they are looking to improve their skills, searching for a career path, or just having fun!

    This application provides them with a trackable public learning experience to present to Hiring Managers.

    Our tracking system provides Developers with the analytics to show them where they excel and what needs improvement. Their profiles can be linked to their resume to show proof of education.

    From the userâ€™s profile, potential clients and recruiters can follow a link to their GitHub as well as view a sample of their most recent work on an embedded codepen

The Recruiters:
Schools:
Can integrate this into their curriculum to track their student's progress. Through the points, badge, and certification system teachers are able to see where students are spending their time and where they may need help.

    Hiring Managers:
        Can use this as a reference point for new applicants, as proof of education.
        By getting a deeper understanding of the user's specialties and interests, hiring managers can better place applicants.
