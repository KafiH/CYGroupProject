        <div id="info">
            <h2 style="text-align:center; margin: 20px 0">Welcome to KESHB Schools! </h2>
            <p>Code Youths Intake-8 has designed a gamified curriculum application that rewards its users incrementally. We strive to not only teach players coding languages but the fundamental practices of learning.</p><br>
            <p>We celebrate every milestone through <b>merit points</b>, <b>badges</b>, and <b>certifications</b>. 
            </p><br>
            <p>As players accumulate merit points they can purchase unique profile photo designs to reflect their personalities. Players can submit their own designs to the shop to be purchased by other players. <br><br>This opens the opportunity for players to support others by purchasing their designs.
            </p><br>
            <p>Using the analytics, we provide players with ‘insights’ into their progress by reflecting on their achievements displayed on the profile page. These insights provide an in-depth analysis of player’s developing ‘specialties’ as well as areas of growth. 
            </p><br>
            <p>Hiring managers and teachers can also use these analytics to track students/applicants' progress. 
            </p><br>
            <p>This allows teachers to assist students in their learning.
            </p><br>
            <p>This allows hiring managers to seek new recruits for roles based on player specialties. 
            </p><br>
            <p>With this application, we hope to bridge the gap for new developers to find employment. By providing a trackable learning path for hiring managers to have concrete evidence of applicants' education.

                    Hi,I want to work in the fields of planning, quality control, lean production techniques, and
                    product
                    management as well as to enjoy everywhere in the field of industrial engineering.

                    I worked as a Quality Engineer and intern Industrial Engineer. I supported the departments of the
                    company I work for in solving their problems, which were mainly related to product and customer
                    feedback
                    by using Kaizen steps. I focused on client issues and found personalized solutions through
                    exploration.
                    In addition, I controlled the store department and the supply company. I ensured the information
                    security of all departments in the company with my team by creating seminars to let everyone know
                    about
                    security. I managed the production department by recording weekly production rates to compare the
                    profits earned per week using 5S. I take pride in focusing on many tasks and details at the same
                    time
                    which makes me quite an efficient employee. Besides, with the code youth program, I have provided
                    proven
                    proficiency in front-end coding and languages including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs and DOM</p>

                <p> Hi I’d like to introduce myself; my name is Kafi Hassan and I'm a dedicated hardworking Front End
                    Developer with proficiency in HTML, CSS , JavaScript with a background in coding, teaching and

                    I have loved creating things since childhood whether it’s stories, poetry and even art. This early
                    fascination grew in me over the years and I acquired a strong knack for creativity and that knack
                    for
                    creativity has led me to coding. As a participant of Code Youth’s three-month intensive training
                    program, I gained proficiency in front
                    end coding languages including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and DOM. The program emphasized project-based
                    learning in an Agile environment, so I am familiar with and have used industry tools such as Jira,
