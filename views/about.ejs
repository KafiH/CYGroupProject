                    Hi,I want to work in the fields of planning, quality control, lean production techniques, and
                    product
                    management as well as to enjoy everywhere in the field of industrial engineering.

                    I worked as a Quality Engineer and intern Industrial Engineer. I supported the departments of the
                    company I work for in solving their problems, which were mainly related to product and customer
                    feedback
                    by using Kaizen steps. I focused on client issues and found personalized solutions through
                    exploration.
                    In addition, I controlled the store department and the supply company. I ensured the information
                    security of all departments in the company with my team by creating seminars to let everyone know
                    about
                    security. I managed the production department by recording weekly production rates to compare the
                    profits earned per week using 5S. I take pride in focusing on many tasks and details at the same
                    time
                    which makes me quite an efficient employee. Besides, with the code youth program, I have provided
                    proven
                    proficiency in front-end coding and languages including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs and DOM</p>

                <p> Hi I’d like to introduce myself; my name is Kafi Hassan and I'm a dedicated hardworking Front End
                    Developer with proficiency in HTML, CSS , JavaScript with a background in coding, teaching and

                    I have loved creating things since childhood whether it’s stories, poetry and even art. This early
                    fascination grew in me over the years and I acquired a strong knack for creativity and that knack
                    for
                    creativity has led me to coding. As a participant of Code Youth’s three-month intensive training
                    program, I gained proficiency in front
                    end coding languages including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and DOM. The program emphasized project-based
                    learning in an Agile environment, so I am familiar with and have used industry tools such as Jira,
