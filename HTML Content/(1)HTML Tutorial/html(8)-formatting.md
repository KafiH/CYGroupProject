HTML Text Formatting

HTML contains several elements for defining text with a special meaning.

HTML Formatting Elements
Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:

<b> - Bold text
<strong> - Important text
<i> - Italic text
<em> - Emphasized text
<mark> - Marked text
<small> - Smaller text
<del> - Deleted text
<ins> - Inserted text
<sub> - Subscript text
<sup> - Superscript text
HTML <b> and <strong> Elements
The HTML <b> element defines bold text, without any extra importance.

Example

<b>This text is bold</b>
The HTML <strong> element defines text with strong importance. The content inside is typically displayed in bold.

Example

<strong>This text is important!</strong>

he HTML <em> element defines emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.

Tip: A screen reader will pronounce the words in <em> with an emphasis, using verbal stress.

Example

<em>This text is emphasized</em>
HTML <small> Element
The HTML <small> element defines smaller text:

Example

<small>This is some smaller text.</small>
HTML <mark> Element
The HTML <mark> element defines text that should be marked or highlighted:

Example

<p>Do not forget to buy <mark>milk</mark> today.</p>
HTML <del> Element
The HTML <del> element defines text that has been deleted from a document. Browsers will usually strike a line through deleted text:

Example

<p>My favorite color is <del>blue</del> red.</p>
HTML <ins> Element
The HTML <ins> element defines a text that has been inserted into a document. Browsers will usually underline inserted text:

Example

<p>My favorite color is <del>blue</del> <ins>red</ins>.</p>
HTML <sub> Element
The HTML <sub> element defines subscript text. Subscript text appears half a character below the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Subscript text can be used for chemical formulas, like H2O:

Example

<p>This is <sub>subscripted</sub> text.</p>
HTML <sup> Element
The HTML <sup> element defines superscript text. Superscript text appears half a character above the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Superscript text can be used for footnotes, like WWW[1]:

Example

<p>This is <sup>superscripted</sup> text.</p>
