HTML Layout Elements and Techniques

Websites often display content in multiple columns (like a magazine or a newspaper).

HTML Layout Elements
HTML has several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:

HTML5 Semantic Elements	
<header> - Defines a header for a document or a section
<nav> - Defines a set of navigation links
<section> - Defines a section in a document
<article> - Defines an independent, self-contained content
<aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
<footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section
<details> - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
<summary> - Defines a heading for the <details> element


HTML Layout Techniques
There are four different techniques to create multicolumn layouts. Each technique has its pros and cons:

CSS framework
CSS float property
CSS flexbox
CSS grid


CSS Frameworks
If you want to create your layout fast, you can use a CSS framework, like W3.CSS or Bootstrap.

CSS Float Layout
It is common to do entire web layouts using the CSS float property. Float is easy to learn - you just need to remember how the float and clear properties work. Disadvantages: Floating elements are tied to the document flow, which may harm the flexibility. 

CSS Flexbox Layout
Use of flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices.

CSS Grid Layout
The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.
